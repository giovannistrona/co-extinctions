## Installation under Debian/Linux

1. Install [IGraph C library](https://igraph.org/c/).

    is not included in the Python distribution" - [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/python-igraph/)
    ```
    sudo apt-get install libigraph0-dev
    ```
2. Install the packages for Python 2.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
